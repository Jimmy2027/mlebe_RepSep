To assess the quality of the pipeline we evaluated the registration performance for different metrices (Crosscorrelation (CC), Mutual Information (MI), Mean Squared Difference (MSQ)) for individual sessions and subjects on a representatitve dataset. Next we calculated the variance of each metric across sessions and subjects for our workflow and the legacy worflow respectively (Figure X).
