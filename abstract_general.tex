Given the need for comparability across subjects and studies, the quality of registration to a standardized space is crucial for the reliability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and in particular functional MRI (fMRI).
Small Animal MRI workflows commonly utilize scripts optimized for human data --- and adapt the data to the analysis rather than vice-versa.
Quality control (QC) is commonly performed by interactive operator inspection, making it infrequent, open to bias, slow, and unreproducible.
In this paper we present a workflow and standard space optimized for mouse brain registration, as well as four separate metrics for automated QC, along with a visualization method to aid operator inspection.
This novel workflow conserves variance across subjects yet minimizes variance across sessions, and outperforms legacy practices
\py{pytex_printonly('scripts/vc_rmser.py')}-fold in terms of volume conservation,
and \py{pytex_printonly('scripts/scf_rmser.py')}-fold in terms of smoothness conservation.
On account of its superior performance and transparency the “SAMRI Generic” workflow is instrumental in the development of specialized small animal MRI analysis workflows, and --- given the release of all code needed to reproduce this publication from raw data --- empowers researchers to optimize and derive publication-ready workflows for their own specific use cases.
