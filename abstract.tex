Given the need for inter-subject and inter-study comparability, spatial map registration to a standardized space is an indispensable part of modern Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
Mouse MRI workflows commonly utilize high-level interfaces optimized for human data --- and adapt the data to the interface rather than vice-versa.
Quality control (QC) is commonly performed by interactive operator inspection, making it infrequent, open to bias, slow, and unreproducible.
In this paper we present a novel registration workflow accessible via both Bash and Python, which uses the full flexibility of low-level interfaces from one of the most popular normalization toolkits (ANTs).
We provide an optimized set of parameters for mouse brain registration, and propose a standard space suited to harmonize mouse brain data across modalities.
Additionally, we present QC workflows, which can automatically assess the registration quality of current as well as past processed datasets.
We showcase the capabilities of this novel workflow compared to a legacy workflow (representative of common practices --- which we detail and comment).
