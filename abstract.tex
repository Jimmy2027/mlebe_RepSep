%%% no, some use heuristic-based masking derived from tweaked human-brain masking presets. You should mention that you are talking about preclinical imaging, as the issue is distinctly less problematic for human brain imaging, where masking has been optimized via manual-machine-learning before automatic machine learning was developed.
Cross-subject and cross-study comparability of preclinical imaging data, whole-brain imaging 
%(e.g. MRI)
data in particular, is contingent on the quality of registration to a standard reference space.
Current methods for neuroimaging rely on full image processing, with high varying intensities outside the brain Region Of Interest that interfere with registration.
Applying the processing to a masked image improves the quality of the latter.
Here we present a deep learning enabled framework for segmentation of brain tissue in functional and structural MR images that when included in a small animal brain imaging workflow significantly improves the quality of the latter.
