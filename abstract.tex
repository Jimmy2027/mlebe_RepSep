%%briefly explain why
%%  - extraction ROI 
%%  - registration into a standard reference space
Cross-subject and cross-study comparability of imaging data in general, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in particular, is contingent on the quality of registration to a standard reference space.
Current methods rely on full image processing, with high varying intensities outside the Region Of Interest that interfere with registration.
Applying the processing to a masked image improves the quality of the latter.
Here, we present as an additional step in the SAMRI registration workflow, a deep learning enabled framework for segmentation of brain tissue in functional and structural MR images.


%As part of the analysis of high-field mouse MRI data, relevant brain tissue needs to be selected via a mask.
%For this process to be performed automatically, brain voxels need to be classified based both on their signal intensity and position in the image.
%Nowadays, deep neural networks are the state-of-the-art methods for tissue segmentation in biomedical imaging, and thus constitute a promising method for preclinical neuroscience.
