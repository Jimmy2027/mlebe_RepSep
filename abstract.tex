As part of the analysis of high-field mouse MRI data, relevant brain tissue needs to be selected via a mask.
For this process to be performed automatically, brain voxels need to be classified based both on their signal intensity and position in the image.
Nowadays, deep neural networks are the state-of-the-art methods for tissue segmentation in biomedical imaging, and thus constitute a promising method for preclinical neuroscience.
%% outperforms current methods is a pretty high bar. We haven't really compared it to e.g. BET and other heuristic human-MRI-derived classifiers. You can still make the case that it is better, but that's a case you need to make on theoretical grounds unless you have data for the comparison.
We present a deep learning enabled framework for segmentation of brain tissue in functional and structural MR images, \textit{that outperforms \textbf{current methods}, requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by them}. \todo{not true}
