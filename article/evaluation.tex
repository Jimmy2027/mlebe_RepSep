\section{Evaluation}

%We evaluate the quality of the registration both in terms of spatial features, as well as in terms of its repercussion on higher-level functional analysis.

A challenge of QC with regard to spatial features is that a perfect mapping to the template is undefined.
Similarity metrics are ill-suited for QC because they are used internally by registration functions, whose main feature it is, that they maximize them.
Indeed extreme maximization, especially via nonlinear transformations, results in distortion of the image, which should be penalized in QC, but in light of image similarity scores is represented as better performance.
Additionally, similarity metrics are not independent, so this issue cannot be circumvented by maximizing a subset of metrics and performing QC via the remainder.
%We thus develop three alternative evaluation metrics: volume conservation, functional analysis, and variance analysis.
We thus develop two alternative evaluation metrics: volume conservation and functional analysis.
In order to mitigate possible differences arising from qualitative template features, we perform a multivariate analysis of both templates and workflows.

\subsection{Volume Conservation}

Volume conservation is based on the assumption that the total volume of the scanned segment of the brain should remain approximately identical after registration.
A volume increase may indicate that the brain was stretched to fill in template brain space not covered by the scan, while a volume decrease might indicate that non-brain voxels were introduced into the template brain space.

In order to best analyze volume conservation, a Volume Change Factor (VCF) is computed for each processed scan, whereby volume conservation is highest for a VCF equal to 1.
For the current implementation we define brain volume as estimated by the 66\textsuperscript{th} voxel intensity percentile of the unregistered scan.
The arbitrary unit equivalent of this percentile threshold is recorded for each scan and applied to all registration workflow results for that particular scan, to obtain VCF esimates
 --- as seen in \cref{eq:vcf}, where $v$ is the voxel volume in the original space, $v^\prime$ the voxel volume in the transformed space, $n$ the number of voxels in the original space, $m$ the number of voxels in the transformed space, $s$ a voxel value sampled from the vector $S$ containing all values in the original data, and $s^\prime$ a voxel value sampled from the transformed data.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:vcf}
        V\!C\!F
        = \frac{v^\prime\sum_{i=1}^m [s^\prime_i \geq P_{66}(S)]}{v\sum_{i=1}^n [s_i \geq P_{66}(S)]}
        = \frac{v^\prime\sum_{i=1}^m [s^\prime_i \geq P_{66}(S)]}{v \lceil0.66n\rceil}
\end{equation}

\begin{sansmath}
\py{pytex_subfigs(
        [
                {'script':'scripts/vc_violin.py', 'label':'vcv', 'conf':'article/1col.conf', 'options_pre':'{.48\\textwidth}',
			'caption':'Comparison across workflows and target templates, considering both BOLD and CBV functional contrasts.'
                        ,},
                {'script':'scripts/vcc_violin.py', 'label':'vccv','conf':'article/1col.conf', 'options_pre':'{.48\\textwidth}',
                        'caption':'Comparison across workflows and functional contrasts, considering only matching template-workflow combinations.'
                        ,},

        label='fig:vc',
        )}
\end{sansmath}

As seen in \cref{fig:vcv}, we note that VCF is sensitive to
the processing workflow (\py{boilerplate.fstatistic('Processing', condensed=True)}),
the template (\py{boilerplate.fstatistic('Template', condensed=True)}),
but not the interaction thereof (\py{boilerplate.fstatistic('Processing:Template', condensed=True)}).

The performance of the Generic SAMRI workflow (with the Generic template) is significantly different from that of the Legacy workflow (with the Legacy template), yielding a two-tailed p-value of \py{pytex_printonly('scripts/vc_t.py')}).
Additionally, the root mean squared error ratio strongly favours the Generic workflow
($\mathrm{RMSE_{L}/RMSE_{G}\simeq} \py{pytex_printonly('scripts/vc_rmser.py')}$).

Descriptively, we observe that the effect with the greatest magnitude is that of the template variable, with its Legacy level introducing a notable volume loss
(VCF of \py{boilerplate.factorci('Template[T.Legacy]')}).
Further, we note that there is a variance increase in all conditions for the Legacy processing workflow
(\py{boilerplate.varianceratio(template='Legacy')}-fold given the Legacy template, and \py{boilerplate.varianceratio(template='Generic')}-fold given the Generic template).

With respect to the data break-up by contrast (from \cref{fig:vccv}), we see no notable main effect for the contrast variable
(VCF of \py{boilerplate.corecomparison_factorci('Contrast[T.CBV]')}).
We do, however, report a notable effect for the contrast-template interaction, with the Legacy workflow and CBV contrast interaction level introducing a volume loss
(VCF of \py{boilerplate.corecomparison_factorci('Processing[T.Legacy]:Contrast[T.CBV]')}).

\subsection{Functional Analysis}

Functional analysis is a viable avenue for registration QC, as the metric being maximized in the registration process is not the same metric used for QC.
This method is however primarily suited to examine workflow effects in light of higher-level applications, and less suited for wide-spread QC (as it is computationally intensive and only applicable to a subset of mouse MRI data).
As a first step we examine statistical power, via the negative logarithm of p-value maps.
We compute the per-scan average of these values, which we term Mean Significance --- as seen in \cref{eq:ms}, where $n$ represents the number of statistical estimates in the scan, and $p$ is a p-value.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ms}
        M\!S = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n -log(p_i)}{n}
\end{equation}

\begin{sansmath}
\py{pytex_subfigs(
        [
                {'script':'scripts/ms_violin.py', 'label':'msv', 'conf':'article/1col.conf', 'options_pre':'{.48\\textwidth}',
			'caption':'Comparison across workflows and target templates, considering both BOLD and CBV functional contrasts.'
                        ,},
                {'script':'scripts/msc_violin.py', 'label':'mscv','conf':'article/1col.conf', 'options_pre':'{.48\\textwidth}',
                        'caption':'Comparison across workflows and functional contrasts, considering only matching template-workflow combinations.'
                        ,},
                ],
        caption='Mean per-animal significance distributions. Coloured patch width estimates distribution density, while continuous markers indicate the sample mean and dashed markers indicate the inner quartiles.',
        label='fig:ms',)}
\end{sansmath}

As seen in \cref{fig:ms}, we note that MS is sensitive to neither the processing workflow
(\py{boilerplate.fstatistic('Processing', dependent_variable='Mean Significance', df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', condensed=True)}),
nor the template
(\py{boilerplate.fstatistic('Template', dependent_variable='Mean Significance', df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', condensed=True)}),
nor the interaction thereof
(\py{boilerplate.fstatistic('Processing:Template', dependent_variable='Mean Significance', df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', condensed=True)}).

Testing the core hypothesis of the comparison ---
whether the performance of the Generic SAMRI workflow (with the Generic template) is significantly different from that of the Legacy workflow (with the Legacy template) ---
we note that it is not
(two-tailed p-value of
\py{pytex_printonly('scripts/ms_t.py')}).
As before, we note that there is a variance increase in all conditions for the Legacy processing workflow
(\py{boilerplate.varianceratio(df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', template='Legacy', dependent_variable='Mean Significance')}-fold
given the Legacy template, and
\py{boilerplate.varianceratio(df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', template='Generic', dependent_variable='Mean Significance')}-fold
given the Generic template).

With respect to the data break-up by contrast (from \cref{fig:mscv}), we see no notable positive main effect for the contrast variable
(MS of
\py{boilerplate.corecomparison_factorci('Contrast[T.CBV]', df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', dependent_variable='Mean Significance')}).
We do, however, report a notable effect for the contrast-template interaction, with the Legacy workflow and CBV contrast interaction level introducing a volume loss
(MS of
\py{boilerplate.corecomparison_factorci('Processing[T.Legacy]:Contrast[T.CBV]', df_path='data/functional_significance.csv', dependent_variable='Mean Significance')}).

Overall statistical power is, however, independent of the mapping accuracy, and functional analysis effects can be further inspected by visualizing statistical maps.
For a succint overview capturing both amplitude and directionality of the signal, we present second-level t-statistic maps depicting the CBV and BOLD omnibus contrasts (across subjects and sessions) in \cref{fig:m}.
While the most salient feature of this figure is the qualitative distribution difference between CBV and BOLD scans, we note that this is to be expected given the different nature of the processes.
More relevant to registration quality is the differential coverage.
We note that the Legacy template universally induces coverage overflow, extending to the cerebellum in all cases (\cref{fig:mglc,fig:mllc,fig:mglb,fig:mllb}), and to the olfactory bulbs when used in conjunction with the Legacy workflow (\cref{fig:mllc,fig:mllb}).
Separately from the Legacy template, the Legacy workflow only causes coverage overflow (both rostrally into the base of the olfactory bulbs and caudally into the cerebellum) for the BOLD contrast (\cref{fig:mlgb}).
Positive activation of the Raphe system, most clearly disambiguated from the surrounding tissue in the BOLD contrast is notably displaced very far caudally by the joint effects of the Legacy workflow and the Legacy template (\cref{fig:mllb}).
We note that the CBV contrast processed with the Generic template and either the Generic or the Legacy workflows (\cref{fig:mggc,fig:mlgc}), as well as the BOLD contrast processed with the Generic template and the Generic workflow (\cref{fig:mggb}) do not show issues of statistic coverage.
