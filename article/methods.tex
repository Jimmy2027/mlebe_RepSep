\section{Methods}
The slice-wise predictions of the model are reconstructed to a 3D mask via the command \textit{Nifit1Image} from the neuro-imaging python package nibabel \cite{noauthor_neuroimaging_nodate}.
This is done using the same affine space as the input image.

For the training of the classifier, the data are separated into a Training, Validation and Test set with the help of the function \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{$train\_test\_split$}} from the package sklearn.model$\_$selection \cite{noauthor_scikit-learn/scikit-learn_2020}.
